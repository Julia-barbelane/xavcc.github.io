Start new writing about "[Why & How to protect your labtop](https://github.com/XavCC/xavcc.github.io/issues/50)"

The purpose is :
+ Prepare it in english language in order to facilitate collaboration
+ Write & publish and then translate in French language in order to help french people
+ [Use github as a back office](https://github.com/XavCC/xavcc.github.io/issues/50).

## 1. What is Spectre & Meltdown

"The issue potentially affects millions of laptops globally." : [see paper](https://phys.org/news/2018-01-finnish-firm-intel-flaw.html)

In 2007, OpenBSD mailing list knew about flaw risks, see : [disussion](https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-misc&m=118296441702631&w=2)

Dedicated to [Ubuntu's wiki](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/SpectreAndMeltdown)

### 1.1 why it's important for every people

### 1.2 But at the End...

1. On va tous mourir
2. Démontez vos processeurs Intel tout de suite

+ [social atttack](https://solaceattack.com)
+ [sky fall](https://skyfallattack.com)

`#CyberApocalypse`

`#CyberArmagédon`

`#CyberFinDuMonde`

## 2. Check 

## 2.1 Your Processor

`$ cat /proc/version`

e.g
> Linux version 4.13.0-32-generic (buildd@lgw01-amd64-016) (gcc version 7.2.0 (Ubuntu 7.2.0-8ubuntu3)) #35-Ubuntu SMP [Date]

### 2.2 Your distribution & some system informations

Using [screenfecth](http://tuxtweaks.com/2013/12/install-screenfetch-linux/)

`$ screenfetch` 

![](/assets/images/screenfecth.png)

### 2.3 Migration or Upgrade your OS

` $ do-release-upgrade --help`

Here are some of the most useful options:

`$ do-release-upgrade --check-dist-upgrade-only`

The `-check-dist-upgrade-only` option checks whether a new version exists. If a new version is found, it is displayed as a result in the terminal. Executed in this way, this command only performs a check  no upgrade is done.

`$ do-release-upgrade --sandbox`

The `--sandbox` option allows you to test an upgrade in a protected environment. This is particularly useful for testing the deployment of an upgrade before it is applied in the production environment.

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ do-release-upgrade
```

upgrade without interaction

```$ do-release-upgrade -f DistUpgradeViewNonInteractive```


Without options, the do-release-upgrade tool searches and upgrades to the next available LTS or stable version, if available. 

## 3. Use a smple command line ([source](http://www.grimoire-command.es/post/2018/Check-if-your-Linux-kernel-is-vulnerable-to-Spectre-or-Meltdown-attacks))
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speed47/spectre-meltdown-checker/master/spectre-meltdown-checker.sh | bash 
```
**Notes**

[1] This is a perfect example of what you should avoid to do as a root user without having read and understood the sources, or really trust the author

[2] Mozilla [mentionned](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/57.0.4/releasenotes/) Spectre & Meltdown mitigation in Firefox starting from version : 57.0.4

## 4. Use spectre-meltdown-checker

### 4.1 Install

using wget:

`$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speed47/spectre-meltdown-checker/master/spectre-meltdown-checker.sh`

Or if you prefer to use Curl:

`$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speed47/spectre-meltdown-checker/master/spectre-meltdown-checker.sh --output spectre-meltdown-checker.sh`

Then

### 4.2  Run the script

According to the permissions that you have for the file, you may be able to execute it using the following command (if you used chmod +x):

`$ sudo spectre-meltdown-checker.sh`

Otherwise without adding permissions to the file, just run the script using sudo bash:

`$ sudo bash spectre-meltdown-checker.sh `

This will start the tool and in matter of seconds you will know if your processor is vulnerable to Spectre or Meltdown:

![](https://framapic.org/z90fntJuGokV/zPKZ9i00PGyJ)

## 5. What are your choices ?

### 5.1 Lottery ?

```
$  sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

Move from Ubuntu 16.04 to Ubuntu 17.10 « The Artful Aardvark » doesn't change anything to the flaws.

### 5.2 Check your CPU activity

'Cause those security flaws affect your cpu's activity
![](https://framapic.org/PMuqIpbG7Q2n/GpR5nDMLnVPd)

Using [`gtop`](https://github.com/aksakalli/gtop)

```
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```
then
` $  sudo npm install gtop -g`

Run
` $ gotp`
![](/asstes/images/gtop.png)

> By the way, it seems `s-tui` had some toubles with Ubuntu, so I Open an [Issue](https://github.com/amanusk/s-tui/issues/52)

it works with `sudo su`

```
pip install s-tui
s-tui
```
![](/assets/images/s-tui.png)

But it will probably, and infortunatly, bring you nothing usefull. Just find indication about activity on your CPU, it's only monitoring, it's not about acces and user privilege ont the central processing unit. 
On the other hand, you may be able to see if your labtop is used to undermine the currency for some other undesirable :-D

## 5.3 Patch ? 

> Yes you can !!!  finally, partially - or not ! 

## 6. Pacth it ! ? Huhuh

### 6.1 Patching Spectre and Meltdown Vulnerabilities:

Spectre and Meltdown patches are delivered as kernel updates on Ubuntu 17.10. Ubuntu 17.10 has been releasing kernel updates as Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities are fixed.

To get these kernel updates, you must have ‘artful-security’ and ‘artful-updates’ repository enabled.
To check whether these repositories are enabled, go to the Applications menu and look for “Software & Updates”. You should see “Software & Updates” app as shown in the screenshot below. Click on it

![](https://framapic.org/PUKzWjIAv062/qEnhNFSky6td)

“Software & Updates” should open. Now click on the marked tab “Updates”.
![](https://framapic.org/oebyEfsC60bf/5Y9C56z9YTi1)

Then You should see the following window. Click on “Reload”. Ubuntu should update its package repository cache.

### 6.2 Check 

Check the version of Kernel you’re using on your Ubuntu 17.10 Artful Aardvark operating system with the following command:

` $ uname -r`

You can see that the version of kernel

e.g `4.13.0-25-generic`

### 6.3 Upgrade & Reboot & Check
Now run the following command to update all the available packages of your Ubuntu 17.10 operating system:

` $ sudo apt-get upgrade`
then

` $ reboot`

after your computer restart

` $ uname -r`

If, on your terminal, you have something like "`Some packages have been kept back
linux-generic linux-headers-generic linux-image-generic ubuntu-desktop`"

do

`$ sudo apt-get install linux-generic linux-headers-generic linux-image-generic ubuntu-desktop`

After all those actions Your kernel should be updated.

```
$ uname -r
4.13.0-32-generic
```
Fot Ubuntu 17.10 Artful Aardvark.

### 6.4 And Now ?

1. `$ sudo bash spectre-meltdown-checker.sh` and Compare with your 1st try
2. Be vigilant and keep track of upcoming changes and patches
3. Updates Instructions, 2018 Jan 22: Ubuntu kernel updates addressing all three vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-5715, CVE-2017-5753, CVE-2017-5754) across amd64, ppc64el and s390x are released in [USN-3541-1 (Ubuntu 17.10)](https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-3541-1/), [USN-3540-1 (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS)](https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-3540-1/), [USN-3541-2 (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (HWE))](https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-3541-2/), [USN-3542-1 (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS)](https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-3542-1/) and [USN-3540-2 (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (HWE))](https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-3540-2/).
